Be sure the Oneportal server module is already located at /whmcs/modules/servers/oneportal prior to accessing the new module from inside of the WHMCS Admin area.
In WHMCS Admin, navigate to Setup -> Addon Modules.
Find the OnePortal Server Import module, (page refreshes), then configure the module to allow Full Administrator or whichever level of access your Admin account has.
Then, navigate to Addons -> OnePortal Server Import in WHMCS Admin. Follow the prompts and you should be offering a full suite of Limestone Networks Dedicated Servers in about 60 seconds.
